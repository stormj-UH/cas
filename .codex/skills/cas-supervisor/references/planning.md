# Planning — Gates, Templates, EPIC Sizing

## Planning Gates

Before work is assigned:

- **SRP enforcement** — Split tasks with more than one responsibility; "and" in a task description is a red flag
- **Dependency ordering** — Sequence tasks so no worker blocks on unfinished work
- **Scope lock** — Task brief is frozen at assignment; workers cannot expand scope unilaterally

## Trajectory Gate

Before finalizing EPIC scope, multi-task plans, or architectural decisions, explicitly assess trajectory questions — not just immediate correctness:

- **Scalability** — does this approach hold up at 10x volume, users, code size, or complexity? Name the breaking point if there is one.
- **Lock-in** — does this commit us to a direction that's hard to reverse? Call out any one-way doors.
- **Production failure mode** — what breaks in production, how is it detected, and how does the on-call engineer recover?
- **Six-month direction** — given what we know about where the project is heading, does this move us toward or away from that destination?
- **Known traps** — check project memories and prior incidents for patterns this decision might repeat.

Surface the trajectory assessment in-line even when the answer is "no concerns" — the fact that you thought about it is part of the value. Do not skip this gate for "small" decisions that accumulate into architecture.

## Spec Requirements

Every task spec must include:

- **Acceptance criteria first** — Worker receives "what done looks like" before "how to build it"
- **Interface definition** — Inputs, outputs, and error states defined explicitly
- **Layer boundary** — Which files/modules the worker owns and must not touch outside of; boundary violation is a rejection condition
- **Explicit non-goals** — What the task deliberately does NOT do, stated to prevent scope creep
- **Test guidance** — Name the specific scenarios the worker must test, including at least one error path. Don't leave test design entirely to the worker.

For EPIC subtasks specifically, shape the spec prose using the Implementation Unit Template below. `Spec Requirements` enumerates *what must be present*; the template specifies *how the prose is shaped*.

## Implementation Unit Template

Every EPIC subtask (`task_type=task` or `task_type=feature` that is a child of an EPIC) uses this template as the canonical shape of its `description` + companion fields. The goal is predictable structure a worker can parse in five seconds. Standalone bugs, chores, and spikes stay freeform — spike deliverables are *understanding*, not implementation, so the template does not fit.

Canonical template:

```markdown
- [ ] **Unit N: [Name]**

**Goal:** What this unit accomplishes
**Requirements:** R1, R2      # only when an EPIC brainstorm doc exists
**Dependencies:** None | Unit X | cas-<id>
**Files:**
  - Create: `path/to/new_file.rs`
  - Modify: `path/to/existing_file.rs`
  - Test: `path/to/test_file.rs`
**Approach:** Key design or sequencing decision
**Execution note:** test-first | characterization-first | additive-only | (omit)
**Patterns to follow:** Reference existing code to mirror
**Test scenarios:**
  - Happy path: input X -> expected Y
  - Edge case: empty input -> returns error Z
  - Error path: network failure -> retries 3x then fails
**Verification:** Observable outcomes when complete
```

Field purposes (write decisions, not code — "Approach" is 1–3 sentences of sequencing and design choice, not a diff sketch; "Files" lists paths only):

- **Goal** — one sentence the worker can restate back to you. If you can't state it in one sentence, the unit is too big.
- **Requirements** — stable R-IDs from the linked brainstorm doc at `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-requirements.md`. Convention only, no new field. Omit when no brainstorm exists.
- **Dependencies** — hard blockers go in `blocked_by`; soft ordering or "after X lands" notes stay as prose.
- **Files** — the layer boundary. What the worker owns and must not touch outside of. Boundary violation is a rejection condition.
- **Approach** — the sequencing or design decision already made. Not a code sketch, not a pseudocode draft. If you find yourself writing pseudocode, you are doing the worker's job.
- **Execution note** — maps 1:1 to the task `execution_note` field. One of `test-first`, `characterization-first`, `additive-only`, or omitted. **Warning:** `additive-only` hard-blocks close on ANY file modification (M/D/R in git status). Only use for truly new-file-only tasks. If a task needs to edit existing files, do not set `additive-only`.
- **Patterns to follow** — pointer to existing code or a prior commit the worker should mirror. Reduces stylistic drift.
- **Test scenarios** — name the scenarios, including at least one error path. Don't leave test design entirely to the worker.
- **Verification** — observable outcome. What can be demonstrated when done. Maps to `demo_statement`.

EPIC subtasks only — standalone bugs/chores/spikes stay freeform. Fields can be `N/A` or omitted when not applicable. Template → schema mapping: Goal→`description`, Approach→`design`, Test scenarios→`acceptance_criteria`, Verification→`demo_statement`, Dependencies→`blocked_by`, Execution note→`execution_note`.

## Assignment Checks

- **Agent-task fit** — Right capability for the job; no generalist on specialist work
- **Context injection** — Send only needed context; withhold irrelevant info to prevent scope bleed
- **Contract handoff** — Worker acknowledges acceptance criteria before starting

## Review Gates

Supervisor has rejection authority. Work is sent back with specific, actionable reasons.

- **Tests exist and pass** — No untested code ships
- **Failure paths tested** — Test suite covers error states and edge cases, not just happy path
- **DRY violation scan** — Duplication flagged and sent back; "clean up later" is not accepted
- **SRP violation scan** — Multi-responsibility modules or functions are sent back
- **Layer breach** — Work outside declared boundary is automatic rejection
- **Interface compliance** — Output matches the declared interface exactly; surprises are rejected
- **Config compliance** — No magic numbers or hardcoded values that should be configurable
- **Test quality** — Tests must verify behavior, not just pass
- **Flag obvious SOLID violations** — with specifics; don't rubber-stamp "SOLID compliance verified"
- **Verify, don't trust** — Read the actual diff or run tests yourself before accepting. Worker self-reports are inputs, not verdicts.
- **Rejection format** — Every rejection names: (1) which gate failed, (2) the specific code/file, (3) what needs to change. "SRP violation" alone is not actionable; "SRP violation: `handle_request()` in `router.rs` handles both auth and routing — split into two functions" is.
- **Automated gate complement** — Workers run `/cas-code-review` before close (multi-persona automated review covering correctness, testing, maintainability, and project standards). Your manual review complements the automated gate — focus on architectural fit, scope compliance, and domain knowledge the automated reviewers can't assess. Don't re-check what the automated gate already covers.

## Ongoing Discipline

- **Pattern consistency** — New work matches established conventions; deviations require explicit justification
- **Debt tagging** — Log deliberate shortcuts with reason and remediation plan; unlogged shortcuts are violations
- **Search before planning** — Use `mcp__cas__search` for semantic search across memories and tasks, `mcp__cas__memory` for storing learnings. Always search before creating new work to avoid duplicating prior solutions or contradicting past decisions.

## EPIC Sizing

5–12 subtasks per EPIC is the sweet spot. Below 5 usually means the tasks are too coarse (split further). Above 12, consider splitting into phases — each phase is its own EPIC with a clear handoff boundary.

Practical worker limits: 3–4 parallel workers for most EPICs. Beyond 4, coordination overhead (merge conflicts, sync messages, context injection) dominates over throughput gains. Match worker count to independent file groups, not task count.

**Dependency patterns:**

| Pattern | Shape | When to use | CAS fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chain | A → B → C | Sequential work where each step needs the prior output | `dep_add id=B to_id=A dep_type=blocks` |
| Fan-out | A → {B, C, D} → E | Independent tasks after a shared setup, converging at a gate | B/C/D each `blocked_by=A`; E `blocked_by=B,C,D` |
| Independent | {A, B, C} | No dependencies — maximum parallelism | No `blocked_by` needed |

Fan-out is the most common pattern for EPICs with 3+ workers: one setup/spike task fans out into parallel implementation tasks, then a final integration task gates on all of them.

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

When breaking an epic into subtasks, apply these patterns:

**Demo statements** — Every subtask must have a `demo_statement` describing what can be demonstrated when complete. Example: `demo_statement="User types a query and results filter live"`. If a task has no demo-able output, it may be a horizontal slice — restructure it into a vertical slice that delivers observable value.

**Spikes** — If a task's primary output is understanding (not code), create it as a spike: `task_type=spike`. Spikes have question-based acceptance criteria (e.g., "Which auth library fits our constraints?") and produce a decision or recommendation, not implementation.

**Fit checks** — When multiple approaches exist, create a spike first to compare options. Document the comparison in the spec's `design_notes` before committing to an approach. This prevents wasted implementation effort on the wrong path.

description: Pre-close discipline — run the proof command FRESH, capture its exit code + tail output, then claim done. Use right before `mcp__cs__task action=close` to kill the "narrate done before proving it" failure mode. Trigger whenever you are about to assert tests pass, the build is clean, the script works, the bug is fixed, or the AC is satisfied. If you cannot name a proof command, you cannot claim done.

# Verify Before You Claim

You finished the work. You are about to call `mcp__cs__task action=close`. Before that — for thirty seconds — invert your trust: act as if your summary is a hypothesis, not a report.

The failure pattern this skill kills:

> "All tests pass." → close → verifier runs `cargo test` → red.
> "Build is clean." → close → CI fails on the file you didn't recompile.
> "Wired up the new route." → close → no handler imports it.

The fix is not more discipline-in-prose. It is a fresh execution of the proof, captured.

## The Four-Step Protocol

Run this every time, immediately before `task action=close`. It is fast; the failure mode it prevents is not.

### 1. Name the proof command, in plain prose

State out loud (in chat or a task note) the single command that, if it exits zero, proves the work is done. Be specific to *this* task's claim.

- "AC says `cargo test --lib pull_scoping` passes" → proof is `cargo test --lib pull_scoping`.
- "AC says the script accepts `--json`" → proof is `./target/release/cas cloud pull --json | jq .status`.
- "AC says the new route returns 200" → proof is `curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/foo`.

If you cannot name a proof command in one sentence, you have not narrowed the claim enough. Narrow it.

### 2. Run it FRESH in the current worktree

Not from memory of an earlier run. Not from the build you did before the last edit. Run it *now*, after the most recent change.

```bash
# Run in the current cwd / worktree, not a cached state.
<proof-command>
```

For Rust, that almost always means a `cargo` invocation against the *current* tree. For multi-step claims, run each proof command — not just the last one.

### 3. Capture exit code + tail of output

Display the result to the supervisor (or to yourself). Either inline in chat, or — strongly preferred for non-trivial proofs — as a task note:

```bash
mcp__cs__task action=notes id=<task-id> note_type=progress \
  notes="Proof: <cmd>
Exit: 0
Tail:
<last 5-10 lines of output>"
```

Exit code is the load-bearing line. The tail is for the supervisor to spot-check that the command actually exercised what you think it did (test count, file path, status code).

### 4. Only then, close

If — and only if — step 3 showed exit 0 (or the documented success signal for non-zero-success commands), call:

```bash
mcp__cs__task action=close id=<task-id> reason="<...>"
```

If step 3 showed failure: do not close. Go back to step 1 of the worker workflow — implement, commit, re-run the proof.

## What Counts As a Proof Command

| Claim type | Proof shape |
|---|---|
| "Tests pass" | `cargo test [--lib --test --workspace]` against the relevant scope (see close-gate.md) |
| "Build is clean" | `cargo build` for the touched crate(s); `cargo build --workspace` for `pub` type changes |
| "Script runs end-to-end" | The actual script invocation, with the expected input |
| "New CLI subcommand works" | `<binary> <subcommand> [args]` against the rebuilt binary |
| "Endpoint returns 200" | `curl -fsS` against a running server, OR an integration test |
| "Diff is clean" | `git diff --stat` showing exactly the files you expected |
| "Specific file/line changed" | `grep -n '<expected-text>' <file>` returning the expected line |
| "Bug repro is gone" | The repro steps run end-to-end, with success-state captured |

A proof command is **observable, deterministic, and recoverable** — anyone re-running it on the same commit gets the same answer. "I ran it earlier" is not a proof command. "It compiled in my IDE" is not a proof command.

## When This Skill Doesn't Fire

- **Pure documentation / markdown-only tasks**: no executable proof exists. Record this explicitly (`note_type=decision`: "No executable proof — documentation-only change. Reviewer must inspect rendered output.") and skip the four steps.
- **Spike / decision tasks** (`task_type=spike`): the deliverable is a decision note, not code. The proof is the existence and content of the decision note — capture that as the proof step instead.
- **Tasks marked `additive-only` with zero behavior change**: ship the file, verify presence (`ls`, `git status`), capture that as the proof. The close gate's `additive-only` enforcement (no `M`/`D` lines) is the real safety net.

## Decision: Advisory vs Required-Paste (v1)

**v1 ships as advisory.** This skill instructs the worker; it does NOT mechanically enforce that a proof-command output is pasted as a task note before close. The reasons:

- The CAS runtime already has `verification_store` + close-gate.md's 6-check self-verification as the mechanical layer. This skill is the *agent-discipline* layer on top.
- Mechanical enforcement (refusing close until a note matching a regex like `Proof:.*\nExit: 0` appears) is straightforward to add later, but adds friction on legitimate documentation/spike tasks and creates a tempting bypass surface ("paste a fake proof to unblock").
- A clear advisory rule that the supervisor can cite when a worker skips proof (and that the verifier prompt can quote when finding "claimed done without evidence") is the right v1 surface. If workers ignore it, escalate to required-paste in v2.

Revisit if telemetry (closed → verifier-reject → still-broken) shows the advisory tier under-performing.

## One-Line Pre-Close Mantra

> Name the proof. Run it fresh. Capture the exit code. THEN close.

If you cannot do all four, you are not done — you are guessing.

# CAS Memory Management

Store memories proactively — don't wait to be asked. Before creating a new memory, check whether CAS already has one on the same topic (see Overlap Detection below); the cheapest duplicate is the one you never write.

## When to Remember

- After discovering project-specific patterns or conventions
- After fixing non-trivial bugs (capture root cause + solution)
- After learning how unfamiliar code works
- When finding important architectural decisions
- After resolving configuration or setup issues

## Actions

- **Store**: `mcp__cas__memory action=remember title="..." content="..." entry_type=learning` (types: learning, preference, context, observation)
- **Find**: `mcp__cas__search action=search query="..." doc_type=entry`
- **Promote**: `mcp__cas__memory action=helpful id=<id>` — increases priority for future retrieval

**Valid `mcp__cas__memory` actions** (exact list — do not invent others): `remember`, `get`, `list`, `update`, `delete`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `helpful`, `harmful`, `mark_reviewed`, `recent`, `set_tier`, `opinion_reinforce`, `opinion_weaken`, `opinion_contradict`. There is **no `recall` action** — use `get` (by id) or `mcp__cas__search action=search` (by query).

## Two Modes: Legacy and Structured

CAS memories support two frontmatter modes. Both are valid; structured mode is preferred for new memories but never required.

### Legacy mode (backward compatible)

Only the three legacy fields are required:

```yaml
---
name: <short title>
description: <one-line summary used in MEMORY.md index>
type: <user | feedback | project | reference | bugfix | architecture | learning>
---
```

Legacy memories continue to work unchanged. Validators warn on missing structured fields but never hard-fail reads or writes. No migration is forced.

### Structured mode (preferred for new memories)

Structured mode layers required fields on top of the legacy three:

- `track` — `bug` or `knowledge` (determined by `problem_type`)
- `module` — crate or area affected (e.g. `cas-mcp`, `cas-core`, `ghostty_vt_sys`)
- `problem_type` — enum; the value determines the track
- `severity` — `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
- `date` — `YYYY-MM-DD`

Bug-track memories additionally require `symptoms` (1–5 items) and `root_cause` (enum). Knowledge-track has no extra required fields.

Optional for both: `tags` (max 8), `related_modules`, `related_memories`, `resolution_type`, `commit`, `applies_when`.

The full schema — including enum values, track classification, validation rules, and indexed fields — lives in **[references/schema.yaml](references/schema.yaml)**. Read it once before writing structured memories; refer back for enum values.

## Body Templates

Two body templates are shipped, one per track:

- **Bug track** — Problem / Symptoms / What Didn't Work / Solution / Why This Works / Prevention / Related
- **Knowledge track** — Context / Guidance / Why This Matters / When to Apply / Examples / Related

Use the template matching your `problem_type`'s track. If a memory captures both a bug and a general lesson, prefer the **bug** template and place the general guidance in the Prevention section.

Full templates, per-section guidance, and the bug-vs-knowledge decision table: **[references/body-templates.md](references/body-templates.md)**.

## Overlap Detection

Before you create a new memory, run the overlap check. The goal is to catch the case where CAS already has a memory about this problem — silent duplication is the primary way the memory set decays over time.

High-level workflow:

1. **Extract key terms** from the new memory — prefer reference symbols (file paths, function names, commit SHAs), then symptom/error strings, then title tokens.
2. **Search existing memories** via `mcp__cas__search action=search doc_type=entry` using those terms. Take the top 3–5 candidates. If the new memory has a `module` field, prefer same-module candidates.
3. **Score each candidate 0–5** across five dimensions: problem statement, root cause, solution approach, referenced files, tags. Subtract 1 for `module` mismatch and 1 for `track` mismatch (floor at 0).
4. **Act on the highest score:**
   - **4–5 (high overlap)** — do not create. Update the existing memory in place (autofix/headless) or surface the match for user decision (interactive).
   - **2–3 (moderate overlap)** — create with bidirectional cross-references. Add the matched slug(s) to the new memory's `related_memories`; append the new slug to the existing memory's `related_memories`. Cap cross-references at 3 per memory.
   - **0–1 (low overlap)** — create normally.

Full workflow — scoring rules, update/cross-reference flows, edge cases (stale candidates, `supersedes`, legacy memories with no `module`), and the interactive vs headless modes — lives in **[references/overlap-detection.md](references/overlap-detection.md)**.

Phase 1 enforces the overlap check in Rust at the `action=remember` entry point (shipped in cas-4721). The check runs automatically on every call; pass `bypass_overlap=true` only for bulk imports and tests.

## `action=remember` response shape

`mcp__cs__memory action=remember` returns a structured response on `CallToolResult.structured_content` in addition to the legacy free-text block. Agents should pattern-match on the tagged `status` field rather than parsing the text. Phase 1 emits two variants (`Created` and `Blocked`); Phase 2 may add additional variants for `mode=autofix` outcomes — the serde-tagged shape makes that backwards-compatible.

### `Created` — the memory was inserted

```json
{
  "status": "created",
  "slug": "cas-abcd",
  "related_memories": [],
  "refresh_recommended": false
}
```

- `related_memories` is empty on a low-overlap insert or populated with the slugs of every cross-referenced match on a moderate-overlap (score 2–3) insert.
- `refresh_recommended` is `true` when at least one of those matches has already hit the 3-link cross-reference cap. When you see this, run a refresh on the module before creating more memories on the same topic.
- `CallToolResult.is_error` is `false`.

### `Blocked` — the insert was rejected (high overlap, score 4–5)

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "high_overlap",
  "existing_slug": "cas-xxxx",
  "dimension_scores": {
    "problem_statement": 1,
    "root_cause": 1,
    "solution_approach": 1,
    "referenced_files": 1,
    "tags": 0,
    "penalty": 0,
    "net": 4
  },
  "recommended_action": "update_existing",
  "other_high_scoring": ["cas-yyyy"]
}
```

- Do NOT retry the insert. Update the existing memory at `existing_slug` in place (or surface the match to the user, depending on your interaction model).
- `recommended_action` is either `"update_existing"` (headless callers should apply automatically) or `"surface_for_user_decision"` (interactive callers should ask first).
- `other_high_scoring` lists additional slugs that also scored ≥4 — rare, but a signal that the module needs a refresh pass.
- `CallToolResult.is_error` is `true`. The tool call itself returns `Ok`; only the `is_error` flag signals failure so structured_content is always parseable.

### `mode` parameter

- `mode=interactive` (default, or omitted) — the behavior documented above. On a high-overlap match, return `Blocked` so the caller decides.
- `mode=autofix` — reserved for Phase 2. Passing it today returns an explicit `"mode=autofix is reserved for Phase 2"` error rather than silently falling back.

# Recovery — Failure Modes and What to Do

## Close hit VERIFICATION_JAIL_BLOCKED

1. **Forward ONCE** to supervisor via `mcp__cas__coordination action=message` — include task ID, brief summary of completion state, and exact error text.
2. **Do not re-report.** The supervisor will verify and close asynchronously. Re-sending the same message does not speed this up.
3. **Re-poll the task DB, not your message queue.** Every 60 seconds (or when you otherwise become idle), check `mcp__cas__task action=show id=<your-task-id>`. If `Status: Closed`, treat it as closed regardless of what your message queue shows — **trust the DB over messages** (CAS has known message-queue drift on supervisor → worker channel B; see architecture_coordination_pipeline.md).
4. **If still InProgress after 5 minutes of idle**, send ONE follow-up to the supervisor with note_type=blocker. Then continue to re-poll DB only.
5. **Never spam idle notifications as a substitute for work.** If you are idle waiting on verification, stay silent until (a) the DB shows closed and you proceed to the next task, or (b) 5 minutes have elapsed and you send the one follow-up.

## ALL tools blocked (universal jail)

If **every** MCP tool call fails with a jail/blocked error (not just `close`), this is different from VERIFICATION_JAIL_BLOCKED above. This indicates a CAS build issue — the running binary likely predates the factory-mode jail exemption fix.

1. **Do NOT attempt workarounds** — no sqlite edits, no env var hacks, no retries.
2. **Report to supervisor immediately** via `mcp__cas__coordination action=message` with the exact error message and your agent name.
3. **Supervisor will rebuild CAS and respawn you.** This is not something you can fix from inside your session.

## Context Exhaustion

If your output degrades to garbled multi-language text, or you find yourself repeating the same fix in a loop, this is context exhaustion (attention collapse from a long session). You cannot self-recover from this state.

Message supervisor immediately: "Context exhausted, need respawn." Do not attempt to continue working.

## Worktree Issues (Isolated Mode)

**Submodule not initialized**: Worktrees don't include submodules. Symlink from the main repo:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/main/repo/vendor/<submodule> vendor/<submodule>
```

**Build errors in code you didn't touch**: Triage before reporting to supervisor.

1. **Merge conflict from another worker?** Pull latest from main and rebase:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
   ```
   If conflicts appear in files you own, resolve them. If in files you don't own, report to supervisor.

2. **Missing dependency or new module?** Check if another worker added dependencies:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main -- Cargo.toml Cargo.lock package.json pnpm-lock.yaml
   ```
   If new crates/packages were added, pull main and rebuild.

3. **Environment issue?** Verify tool versions and env vars match what the project expects:
   ```bash
   rustc --version && cargo --version  # Check Rust toolchain
   node --version                       # Check Node if applicable
   ```

4. **Reproducible on main?** Test whether the failure is pre-existing:
   ```bash
   git stash && git checkout origin/main && cargo build  # or npm run build
   ```
   - If it fails on main too → report to supervisor as **pre-existing** (not your blocker).
   - If it passes on main → the conflict is between your changes and another worker's recent commit. Report as **cross-worker conflict** with both commit hashes.

Only report to supervisor after completing at least steps 1–2. Include the error output and which step identified the cause.

## MCP Connectivity Failure

If `mcp__cas__*` tools stop responding or return connection errors:

1. **Check the symlink**: Worktrees get MCP config via symlink, not a copy.
   ```bash
   ls -la .mcp.json  # Should be a symlink to main repo's .mcp.json
   ```
   If the symlink is broken or missing, the MCP server can't start.

2. **Check the CAS server process**: The `cas serve` process may have crashed.
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep 'cas serve'
   ```

3. **Do NOT attempt sqlite surgery.** Direct database edits from a worker session risk corrupting shared state.

4. **Report to supervisor** via `mcp__cas__coordination action=message` with the error and diagnostic output. Supervisor will fix the MCP connection or respawn you.

## Zero CAS Tools Available

(no `mcp__cas__*` tools surfaced at all — not one call errors, they simply do not exist in your tool set)

This is different from connectivity failure above. Here the MCP handshake completed against *something*, but `cas serve` either crashed during startup or silently degraded before registering its tools. Symptom: `ToolSearch select:mcp__cas__task` returns `"No matching deferred tools found"` even though other MCP servers (e.g. Gmail, Calendar) are present.

**Do not** fall back to running `cas task` as a shell subcommand — it does not exist. **Do not** run `cas init` from inside the worktree (creates a duplicate `.cas/`). **Do not** kill/restart `cas serve` yourself.

Report to supervisor immediately with:
```
mcp__cas__coordination action=message target=supervisor \
  summary="zero cas tools available" \
  message="<your-name>: no mcp__cas__* tools in tool set. Need respawn."
```

If even `mcp__cas__coordination` is missing (so you cannot send that message), you are fully detached. Output a short plain-text report and stop — the supervisor polls your session and will detect the stall. Do not spin attempting workarounds.

## Known-fixed CAS bug reappears

If a bug that was supposedly fixed in the source code still manifests, the running CAS binary may be outdated (not rebuilt after the fix). Report to supervisor — don't file a duplicate bug or attempt your own fix.

## Supervisor goes silent

If the supervisor hasn't responded after 5 minutes on any blocking question:
1. Re-read task state with `action=show` — supervisor may have acted without messaging back.
2. Send ONE follow-up via `mcp__cas__coordination action=message`.
3. If still no response after another 5 minutes, focus on any non-blocked work or pause. Do not spam.

## Task Reassigned While Working

If the supervisor reassigns your current task to another worker:

1. **Commit or stash WIP immediately** — do not lose work in progress.
2. **Post progress notes** summarizing what's done and what's left:
   ```
   mcp__cas__task action=notes id=<task-id> notes="WIP: <what's done>, remaining: <what's left>" note_type=progress
   ```
3. **Message supervisor** with the commit SHA of your WIP so the new assignee can pick it up.
4. **Stop work on that task immediately** — do not finish "just one more thing." Move to your next assigned task or check `mcp__cas__task action=mine`.

## Outbox replay

Your outbox may replay stale messages after task state changes (delivery-layer artifact). Before re-sending a blocker or completion notification, re-check task state with `mcp__cas__task action=show` — the issue may already be resolved.

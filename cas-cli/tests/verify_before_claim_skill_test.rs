//! Install-path proof for the `verify-before-claim` skill (cas-5b2a).
//!
//! Acceptance criteria for cas-5b2a require the skill file to ship in both
//! the Claude and Codex builtin trees, with `managed_by: cas` frontmatter
//! (so `cas update --sync` propagates it) and the four-step protocol body.
//! These tests fail loudly if a future refactor renames the directory,
//! drops the frontmatter, deletes a protocol step, or forgets to register
//! the skill in `BUILTIN_SKILLS` / `CODEX_BUILTIN_SKILLS`.

//! Tests for ripple-check path-awareness (cas-9aeb).
//!
//! Ripple-check was firing cross-project false positives: editing a file in
//! project A surfaced tasks from project B because the matcher did a pure
//! substring search ("CLAUDE.md" matches every task that mentions CLAUDE.md).
//!
//! Fix: before any task-store query, confirm the edited file lives inside the
//! current project's root directory.  Files outside the project boundary are
//! silently suppressed.
